# Hello World 👋  

I am a passionate **Business Intelligence Architect & Developer** with 8+ years of strong background in **data analytics** and **data visualization**.

I specialized in **Microsoft Fabric**, **Power BI**, and the entire Microsoft ecosystem (**Power Automate**, **Power Apps**, **SharePoint**, **Excel w/ VBA**) to architect and implement long-term, scalable business solutions.
 
I started my career as analytical data consultant in the market research industry where I worked for 4 years. Later I moved to a more BI role in the internet-services related industry, for 2.5 years, where I started to become really passionate about Power BI and its uses behind data visualization. 

Now I am Data Scientist Manager in Mastercard where I am contributing in creating for my department: the data infrastructure in Fabric, the reporting infrastructure with Power BI and several operational systems, combining Power BI with Power Automate and Power Apps. Here I am elevating my skills as I need to combine technical/analytical knowledge with strategical thinking for designing and developing the solutions.

I also like to take part in some data challlenges, from time to time, and I am proud of having obtained some good results.

<br>**Why this GitHub account?**

As the BI community out there is fantastic and you can really find any sort of resources when you need, I decided to create this space where I can give back to the community. I will not be posting new contents every day or week; my concept here is that whenever I do a personal project, or I do something at work that I believe is interesting to be shared (a new viz technique, a process automation, an interesting workaround, etc.) , I will put it here. 
I will also share sample codes and step-by-step guides so everyone will be able to replicate what I am doing.
